This repository demonstrates a common Objective-C bug involving delegate callbacks and memory management. The `bug.m` file contains code that reproduces the issue, where a delegate object might be deallocated before a callback is invoked, leading to a crash. The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version with proper memory management techniques to prevent the crash.  The solution uses weak references to prevent retain cycles and ensures the delegate is still valid before invoking methods.
